# FInal-Project-Sem-1
Algorithm &amp; Programming final project
Student ID: 2702337230

This is the final project repository of the L1BC Algorthm and Programming class. 

Project description:
This is a topdown-survival-bullet-hell-shoot-em-up game made entirely in python with the pygame library.
As you can probably tell, this project takes heavy inspiration from Vampire Survivors and the Touhou Series.
The goal is to survive for as long as possible, gaining score by killing enemies that continuously spawn.
The original idea was to have two modes, survival and stages. But as for the time being, it will only
have a survival mode. 

Controls:
W,A,S,D - Movement
Mouse Cursor - Aiming
Left & right Click - Fire & Alt-fire
1,2,3 - Switch to different weapons
ESCAPE = pauses game

How to play:
- Download repository as zip
- open the Final-Project-Sem-1 main folder in a code editor
- run main.py

Final remarks:
This project was a blast to work on. I learnt many new things about python and game dev in general.
While i've been working on this projct non-stop from since i started, i honestly quite enjoyed
the journey. Perhaps i should enjoy this for as long as i can before i get into Java, C, or C++. 
Overall, even if i could've polished a thing or two given more time, i am quite satisfied with the results.
I just wished i started sooner.
